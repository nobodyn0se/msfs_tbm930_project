# MSFS TBM 930 Project 0.5.0 Beta
This is the improvement project for the MSFS default TBM 930.

I suggest using the [msfs-navsystems-performance mod](https://github.com/Smirow/msfs-navsystems-performance) for G3000 extra funcionalities and performance.

([Working-Title](https://github.com/Working-Title-MSFS-Mods/fspackages) guys are also working on a G3000 mod)

And for liveries, see [this thread](https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/turboprop-master-livery-list/168196/16) on forum.

Current features of this modification are:

* **Removed the 30% gap between 0 and 30% throttle:**

tp_high_idle_throttle_pos = 0; *(default = 30)*

...so then I needed to ajust:

n1_to_shaft_torque_table = ... 68:0.12, 87:0.88 ...

* **Ajusted autopilot maximum pitch:**

max_pitch = 15 *(default = 10)*

* **Corrected some numbers:**

pitch_takeoff_ga = 10 *(default = 8)*

min_n1_for_starter_cutoff = 52 *(default = 50)*

min_n2_for_starter_cutoff = 80 *(default = 200)*

rated_shaft_hp = 850 (default = 0)

CG_aft_limit = 0.355 *(default = 0.36)*

rotation_speed_min = 80 *(default = 90)*

cruise_alt = 31000 *(default = 30000)*

best_glide = 120 *(default = 0)*

* **Ajusted torque vs air density table:**

density_on_torque_table = 0.0005:0.01, 0.0006:0.4, 0.0007:0.75, 0.000895:0.794, 0.001144:0.841, 0.001459:0.891, 0.001862:0.944, 0.002378:1.000

(Calculated using 5,6% decrease on torque every 21.63% decrease on density.)

*(default = 0.0005:0.01, 0.0006:0.4, 0.0007:0.6, 0.0008:0.75,  0.0009:0.9,0.000975:1.0, 0.002378:1.000000)*

* **Landing gear creates more drag (by [PositiveZero](https://forums.flightsimulator.com/u/positivezero/summary)):**

drag_coef_gear = 0.04700 *(default = 0.01000)*

* **Decreased inertial separator effect in torque to 7/8 (now 22%, instead of 25%):**

(L:XMLVAR_InertSep#ID#_Deployment) 14336 * (&gt;K:ANTI_ICE_GRADUAL_SET_ENG#ID#) (default = 16384)

* **Added [Uwaâ€™s light mod](https://github.com/Uwajimaya/FS2020) 1.0**

* **Transponder now starts on Stand by when started cold and dark**

* **COM1, COM2 and ADF frequencies changed when started cold and dark**

* **Added [kaosfere's dmimmable G3000 panels](https://github.com/kaosfere/msfs-fixes/tree/master/fixes/tbm930_lighting_fix)**

* **Primary VNAV code, thanks to Javier1235**

* **ITT fixes, thanks to Javier1235**

## Known Issues:

- ITT is a big problem. If I increase it, it overheats on the ground, and if a decrease it, it stays too low on cruise level. Asobo's cfg is very limited.

- Inertial Separator is working but not indicating as "ON" in the panel;

- Still testing fuel consumption. If you enconter any problems, let me know.
